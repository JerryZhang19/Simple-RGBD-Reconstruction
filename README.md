# A Simple Sparse Odometry Based RGBD Reconstruction

This project uses Intel Realsense D435i RGB-D sensor. Here is some preliminary pointcloud reconstruction result.

Odometry part uses optical flow tracking and bundle adjustment optimization implemented in g2o.

This repo focuses on mapping, here is another repo that focuses on odometry and uses similar code structure. https://github.com/JerryZhang19/Realsense_RGBD_Odometry

## Ongoing work
TSDF voxel hashing and Marching Cube.

GPU Reconstruction and realtime paralell reconstruction and localization.

## Future work

Loop Closure

Sparse map saving in a way suitable for relocalization.


## Reference

slambook2 https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook2 gives a great introduction to Visual SLAM.

Code framework of RGB-D Visual Odometry part is inherited from slambook2 ch13 (streo odometry).
